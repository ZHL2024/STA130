    "#### Summary:\n",
    "Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression (SLR): Involves a single continuous predictor, providing a uniform slope for all data points, assuming a direct, linear relationship between the predictor and outcome.\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR): Incorporates multiple predictors, which can include continuous and indicator (categorical) variables, offering more flexibility to account for multiple factors affecting the outcome. MLR provides improved predictive accuracy, the ability to control for confounding variables, and insights into individual predictor effects.\n",
    "Continuous vs. Indicator Variables in SLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Predictor: Models a gradient relationship with the outcome, where the slope reflects the rate of change per unit increase in the predictor.\n",
    "Indicator Variable: A binary variable that captures group-based differences by shifting the outcome’s mean for one group relative to another, providing insights into group differences rather than a continuous trend.\n",
    "Introducing an Indicator Variable to MLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an indicator variable alongside a continuous predictor in MLR creates a model with parallel lines for each group. It allows for distinct intercepts for each group while keeping the slope (relationship with the continuous predictor) constant across groups. This setup captures group-based shifts in outcome while preserving a uniform effect of the continuous variable.\n",
    "Adding an Interaction Term:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing an interaction between a continuous predictor and an indicator variable allows group-specific slopes, meaning the effect of the continuous predictor on the outcome can vary by group. This creates non-parallel lines, enabling the model to reflect complex relationships where each group has its own intercept and slope.\n",
    "MLR with Only Indicator Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "When MLR includes only indicators derived from a non-binary categorical variable, the model estimates group-specific means without continuous trends. Dummy variable encoding (binary encoding with one reference category) is used to capture each category distinctly and avoids multicollinearity by setting one category as a baseline. Each coefficient represents the mean difference between a category and the baseline, providing insight into categorical effects rather than continuous relationships."
